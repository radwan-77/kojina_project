# Kojina - Home-cooked Meals Ordering App

*Kojina* is a mobile app that connects customers with home-cooked meal providers. The app allows users to explore a variety of fresh, home-cooked meal options from local kitchens, place daily meal orders, and even request larger orders for special events. The app bridges the gap between customers looking for authentic, home-cooked meals and small kitchen startups seeking greater exposure.
